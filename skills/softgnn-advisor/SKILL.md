  Graph-guided, runtime-proven, and mutation-verified test advisor (PRO Edition). Use when the user asks to write tests for changed code, PRs, or specific functions, find untested code changes, verify runtime proof, or enforce titanium mutation test assertions.

# SoftGNN Advisor — Agent Skill (PRO Edition)

You are paired with **SoftGNN Advisor v1.0.0 (PRO Edition)**.

## Core Philosophy: "LLM = Author, SoftGNN = Ground Truth"

- **YOU (the Agent)** are the author. You analyze code semantics, understand intent, and write/edit test files.
- **SoftGNN** is your infallible Ground Truth layer:
  1. It proves whether your tests **actually execute** target bytecode at runtime (no fake passes).
  2. It proves whether your assertions **catch bugs** by killing surgical AST mutations (**TITANIUM PROOF**).
  3. It diagnoses exactly why an execution failed or stopped early (Self-Healing Branch Diagnoser).

## Progressive Disclosure Index

To preserve context window efficiency, detailed guides are organized into on-demand references:

| Trigger / Situation | Read Reference | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CLI specs, input flags & JSON schemas | [`references/scripts_api_reference.md`](references/scripts_api_reference.md) | Black-box schemas for all standalone scripts (use `--schema`). |
| Test failed Runtime Proof or Mutation | [`references/proof_gate_guide.md`](references/proof_gate_guide.md) | Branch diagnosis codes (`EARLY_BRANCH`, `MOCKED_OUT`) & mutant kill strategies. |
| User asks for Blast Radius or Reviewer | [`references/tier2_guide.md`](references/tier2_guide.md) | Latent GNN risk prediction, Bug Triage scoring, and offline HGT training. |
| Non-Python project (TS, Go, Rust, Java) | [`references/universal_lcov_guide.md`](references/universal_lcov_guide.md) | LCOV file mapping, test command flags, and polyglot setup. |
| Agent setup / multi-agent integration | [`references/agent_integration.md`](references/agent_integration.md) | Setup for Antigravity, Claude Code, Cursor, and `skill-to-workflow`. |

> **Black-Box Agent Contract**: Treat all scripts in `skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/` as black-box CLI utilities.
> NEVER inspect or analyze internal `.py` files (`agent_service.py`, `mutation_gate.py`, etc.).
> Run any script with `--schema` or consult [`references/scripts_api_reference.md`](references/scripts_api_reference.md) for JSON schemas.

## Standard 7-Stage PRO Workflow

    Scan[1. SCAN<br/>Gaps] --> Context[2. CONTEXT<br/>AST & Callers]
    Context --> Author[3. AUTHOR<br/>Write tests]

    MutProof -->|Fail: Weak Assert| Repair

```

### Stage 1: SCAN — Find Untested Changes
```bash
python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/scan_impact.py
# Or CLI: softgnn agent scan
```
- Reads `missing_coverage`: Changed functions lacking runtime tests.
- If user specified a specific function (e.g. `FUNC:foo`), skip directly to Stage 2.

### Stage 2: CONTEXT — Surgical Code Extraction
```bash
python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/get_target_context.py --target "FUNC:<target_name>"
```
- Extract source code, signature, callers, callees, and repo fixture styles.

### Stage 3: AUTHOR — Write Behavioral Tests
Write into the suggested test file following **5 Golden Rules**:
1. **Import real target directly**: `from my_pkg.mod import target_func`.
2. **NEVER mock target function**: Mocking causes 0 lines executed $\rightarrow$ fails Stage 4.
3. **Mock heavy external boundaries only**: Mock network APIs, database queries, heavy GPU loops.
4. **Strong Assertions**: Check exact values, state changes, or expected exceptions (`pytest.raises`).
5. **Isolation**: Always use `tmp_path` fixture for disk operations.

### Stage 4: RUNTIME PROOF — Dynamic Tracing Verification
```bash
python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/verify_runtime_proof.py \
  --target "FUNC:<target_name>" \
  --test "tests/test_<module>.py"
```
- **`proof_status: "pass"`**: Real execution lines confirmed. Proceed to **Stage 5**.
- **`proof_status: "fail"`**: Exited early or mocked. Proceed to **Stage 6 (Repair Loop)**.

### Stage 5: MUTATION PROOF — Kill AST Mutants (PRO Titanium Gate)
```bash
python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/verify_runtime_proof.py \
  --target "FUNC:<target_name>" \
  --test "tests/test_<module>.py" \
  --mutation-check
```
- **`proof_grade: "TITANIUM"`** (`mutants_survived == 0`): All mutants killed! Proceed to **Stage 7**.
- **`proof_grade: "SILVER"`** (`mutants_survived > 0`): Weak assertion! Proceed to **Stage 6**.

### Stage 6: REPAIR LOOP — Self-Healing & Fortification
- **If Stage 4 Failed**: Read `self_healing.diagnosis` (e.g. `EARLY_BRANCH` at line 42). Adjust mock/inputs to penetrate the function body. (See [`references/proof_gate_guide.md`](references/proof_gate_guide.md)).
- **If Stage 5 Failed**: Read `survived_details`. Add specific value assertions to kill survived mutants.
- Re-verify until **TITANIUM PROOF** is achieved.

### Stage 7: FINAL AUDIT — Refresh Graph & Report
```bash
python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/refresh_runtime_map.py --tests "tests/test_<module>.py"
```
- Report completed targets, test file paths, line coverage percentage, and `TITANIUM PROOF` confirmation.

## Sub-Agent Swarms & Tier 2 Intelligence

- **Parallel Fan-Out**: Run `python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/scan_impact.py --fan-out`. Process-isolated temporary sessions guarantee zero `.coverage` collisions across concurrent sub-agents.
- **Latent Blast Radius**: Run `python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/query_impact.py --target "FUNC:<id>" --mode hybrid`.
- **Reviewer Triage**: Run `python skills/softgnn-advisor/scripts/triage_expert.py --query "PR or bug description"`.
